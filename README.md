## Impact of Discounts on Product Ratings & Sales – Power BI Dashboard

### Project Overview

This project explores how discounts influence product sales and customer satisfaction on Amazon. Using **Power BI and DAX measures**, I built an interactive dashboard that combines product, pricing, and customer review data. The goal was to uncover patterns between revenue, discount strategies, and customer ratings, helping businesses make smarter pricing and marketing decisions.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following key columns:

Product Details: Product ID, Product Name, Category

Pricing: Actual Price, Discount Price, Discount Percentage

Customer Feedback: Rating, Rating Count, Review Title, Review Content

Links: Product Image, Product Link

User Data: User ID, Username, Review ID

## Tools & Techniques

Power BI – Data cleaning, modeling, and visualization

DAX – Custom measures for sales, discount analysis, and rating aggregation

Data Modeling – Relationships between product, pricing, and reviews

Interactive Filters – Category, price range, and ratings

## Dashboard Features

* KPIs at a glance – Total Sales, Average Discount %, Average Rating, Total Reviews
* Category Analysis – Compare sales and discounts across product categories
* Discount vs Ratings (Scatter Plot) – Understand how discount ranges impact ratings and review counts
* Top 10 Products by Reviews – Identify most popular products and their ratings
* Slicers – Dynamic filtering by category, price range, and rating

## Key Insights

Moderate discounts (10–30%) often maintain higher ratings compared to deep discounts.

Some categories generate strong sales with minimal discounts, while others depend heavily on price cuts.

Products with the highest review counts are typically offered with mid-range discounts.
